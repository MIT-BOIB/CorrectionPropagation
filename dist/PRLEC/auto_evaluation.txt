r=32,128
l=4,32
spacing=128

# r denotes the region size in pixel; e.g. r=32 describes a region of 32x32 pixel
# l denotes the lines spacing in the given region r; e.g. l=4 corrects every fourth line in the region
# spacing denotes the stride between subsequent calculations over the en face plane: e.g. spacing=1 means 
# that the rectangle r is shifted by 1 pixel to the right/down in the next step
