The documentation was build using sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

All files for the documentation are located in the "doc" directory.
If you add a new module, etc., and want to document it, you have to create a '.rst' file in "doc".

Assuming the new pyhton module is named "TestClass.py" located in "OCT_GUI/TestPackage/", the file
should be created as follows.

1) Name the file TestClass.rst and add the content. 
   ATTENTION: Before :members:, you MUST ENTER EXACTLY 3 SPACES 

.. automodule:: OCT_GUI.TestPackage.TestClass
   :members:

2) Open index.rst and add (ATTENTION: Before TestClass, you MUST ENTER EXACTLY 3 SPACES )
   
   TestClass 

3) In your command prompt, change to the "doc" directory and run 

make html
